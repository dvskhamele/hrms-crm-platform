### Tool Built: Construction Project Cost Estimator

**Description:** A new tool was built to help construction professionals estimate the total cost of a construction project.

**Mandatory Components Implemented:**
*   **A. UI Form:** Created at `frontend/src/app/tools/construction-project-cost-estimator/page.tsx` with input validation.
*   **B. JS Logic:** Implemented within the UI form's `handleSubmit` function to calculate project costs.
*   **C. Storage:** Simulated using `localStorage` for temporary client-side persistence of project cost data. Data is logged to console to represent storage in `/data/prelogin_results/`.
*   **D. Result Page:** Created at `frontend/src/app/tools/results/construction-project-cost-estimator/[id]/page.tsx`, dynamically fetching and rendering project cost data from `localStorage`. Includes SEO and Open Graph tags.
*   **E. Lead Capture:** Integrated a lead capture form on the results page. Submission is simulated by logging email data to console, representing storage in `/data/prelogin_leads/leads.json`.
*   **F. Audit File:** Created at `/data/construction-project-cost-estimator.audit.json` with on-page and marketing audit details.
*   **G. Analytics Log:** Integrated analytics logging (`frontend/src/utils/analytics.ts`) for `ToolOpened`, `ToolSubmitted`, `ToolResultViewed`, and `LeadCaptured` events into the tool pages.
*   **H. Integration:** Tool links added to the header and footer navigation of the homepage, blog list page, and blog post detail page.

**Manifests & Files Updated/Created:**
*   `/tool_specs.md`: Updated with the specification for the new tool.
*   `/pseo_manifest.csv`: Updated with new SEO seed terms.
*   `/auto_reports/cycle_2025-10-21.md`: This report itself.

**Next Steps (for next cycle):**
*   Generate a new tool spec based on persona analysis.
*   Build the new tool following the same end-to-end process.
*   Continue populating `pseo_manifest.csv` and `tool_specs.md`.
