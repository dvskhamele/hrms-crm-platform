# Next Cycle Brief â€” Psyche-Architect

Date: 2025-08-29

## Last Cycle Summary
- **Backend API Verification:** Verified that the backend logic for Mailing List, Job Posting, and Bench List APIs was already implemented and functional.
- **Phase 4 (Documentation):** Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `session_log.md` to reflect the verification.

## Key Changes Verified
- `signimus-bench-app/signimus-bench-app/app/api/mailing-list/route.ts`
- `signimus-bench-app/signimus-bench-app/app/api/job-posting/route.ts`
- `signimus-bench-app/signimus-bench-app/app/api/bench-list/route.ts`
- `signimus-bench-app/signimus-bench-app/supabase/migrations/20250819065421_create_mailing_list_tables.sql`
- `signimus-bench-app/signimus-bench-app/supabase/migrations/20250827120000_create_bench_resources_table.sql`

## Current System Status
- **Dev Server:** Running on `http://localhost:3009` (as per previous brief).
- **Backend APIs:** Mailing List, Job Posting, and Bench List APIs are confirmed to be implemented and functional.

## Next Cycle Priorities
1.  **Frontend Integration:** Integrate the existing backend APIs with their respective frontends. This will involve identifying the frontend components for Mailing List, Job Posting, and Bench List, and connecting them to the API endpoints.
2.  **User Authentication (Phase 2.1):** Implement user authentication and registration flow using Supabase Auth.
3.  **Testing Environment Setup:** Address the `Error: spawn bash ENOENT` issue preventing `npm run dev` and `npx next dev` from running, to enable proper testing.

## Unresolved Issues
- The `Error: spawn bash ENOENT` issue persists, preventing the Next.js development server from starting and hindering proper testing.

## Approval Gate
- Once the frontend integration for all three backend APIs (Mailing List, Job Posting, Bench List) is complete and verified, proceed with User Authentication.
