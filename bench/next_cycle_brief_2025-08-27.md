## Last Cycle Summary
- **Job Posting Backend Implementation:** Implemented the backend logic for the "Job Posting" tool, including a new API route and integration with Supabase.
- **Bench List Backend Implementation:** Implemented the backend logic for the "Bench List" tool, including a new API route and refactoring the frontend to use it, eliminating dummy data.

## Next Cycle Priorities
1.  **Supabase Table Creation:**
    *   Manually create the `job_postings` and `bench_resources` tables in Supabase, if they don't already exist.
    *   Populate `bench_resources` with some initial data for testing.
2.  **Error Handling & Validation:**
    *   Implement more robust error handling and input validation for the "Job Posting" and "Bench List" API routes.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   Write unit and integration tests for the new API routes and frontend changes.

## Approval Gate
- Once the Supabase tables are confirmed to exist and populated with initial data, proceed with error handling and validation.
