# PLAN.md

## Project Analysis & Growth Hypothesis

* Determine if a project is New or Existing automatically.
* Check for .git, package.json, framework config files (next.config.js, vercel.json, etc.).
* For empty directories, classify as "New Project"; for existing code, classify as "Existing Project".

## Detailed Action Plan

* Devise a full strategy to acquire first 1,000 users.
* Integrate application features with at least one primary growth flywheel (Programmatic SEO, Viral Loop, Content Syndication).

## Credential Ingestion & Final Confirmation

* Never ask for secrets directly.
* Required credentials: SUPABASE keys, DOPPLER tokens, etc.
* If Doppler exists, fetch secrets from Doppler automatically.
* If credentials are missing, log the missing keys in output, but do not interrupt execution unnecessarily.

## Phased Autonomous Execution (Infrastructure, DB schema, Core Features, Growth Flywheel, Deployment)

* Execute all low-level technical decisions.
* Present high-level plans for my review before proceeding to multi-stage implementation.
* Follow workflow stages:
  * Stage 1: Project Analysis & Growth Hypothesis
  * Stage 2: Detailed Action Plan
  * Stage 3: Credential Ingestion & Final Confirmation
  * Stage 4: Phased Autonomous Execution (Infrastructure, DB schema, Core Features, Growth Flywheel, Deployment)

## Logging & Monitoring

* Report what was executed, what was skipped, and why.
* Log all environment, credential, and execution issues.
* Each phase output must include "Next Recommended Action" and wait for my explicit "next" command.

## Parallel Project Handling

* Multiple projects may run in parallel.
* Track each project's progress independently.
* Always maintain session state per project.

## Output

* Generate PLAN.md for action plans.
* Generate project brief and growth hypothesis per project.
* Log missing credentials, skipped steps, and errors.
