## Frontend Integration

The following files have been created and integrated to connect the frontend with the backend APIs:

1. **Mailing List Subscription Form (`/components/MailingListForm.tsx`)**:
   - Created a form component to capture email address.
   - On form submission, makes a POST request to `/api/mailing-list` with the email.
   - Displays success or error messages based on the API response.
   - Integrated into `/app/tools/mailing-list/page.tsx`.

2. **Job Posting Form (`/components/JobPostingForm.tsx`)**:
   - Created a form component to capture job details (job title, company name, location, job description, notify on resume submission).
   - On form submission, makes a POST request to `/api/job-posting` with the job details.
   - Displays success or error messages based on the API response.
   - Integrated into `/app/tools/job-posting/page.tsx`.

3. **Bench List Display (`/components/BenchList.tsx`)**:
   - Created a component to display the list of bench resources.
   - On component mount, makes a GET request to `/api/bench-list` to fetch the data.
   - Renders the fetched data in a table format.
   - Integrated into `/app/bench-list/page.tsx`.

## User Authentication (Phase 2.1)

1. **Supabase Auth Setup**:
   - Configure Supabase Auth in the project.
   - Set up sign-up and sign-in flows.

2. **Authentication Context (`/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)**:
   - Created a React context to manage user authentication state.
   - Implemented functions for sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out.
   - Integrated into the application's root layout (`/app/layout.tsx`).

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Created a `ProtectedRoute` component (`/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`) to wrap pages that require authentication.
   - Created a `useRequireAuth` hook (`/hooks/useRequireAuth.tsx`) for components that need to enforce authentication.

4. **User Profile**:
   - Created a user profile page (`/app/profile/page.tsx`) to display user information.
   - Created an API endpoint (`/app/api/profile/route.ts`) to update user profile information.

## Testing Environment Setup

1. **Fix `Error: spawn bash ENOENT`**:
   - Investigate the root cause of the error.
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
   - Verify that the development server can start and run properly.

## Growth Plan

**Growth Hypothesis:** By enhancing the 'Immediate Value' tools (like the Mailing List and Job Posting forms) with more direct, actionable insights and clear calls to action for sharing, we can increase user engagement and drive viral loops, leading to a 15% increase in new user sign-ups within the next month.
