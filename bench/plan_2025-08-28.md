# Growth Hypothesis & Plan (2025-08-28)

## Growth Hypothesis:
By providing a seamless platform for IT professionals to discover and apply for relevant job opportunities, and for companies to post their requirements and find qualified bench resources, we will significantly increase user engagement and facilitate successful placements.

## Synergy Analysis:
The "Mailing List," "Job Posting," and "Bench List" tools work synergistically:
*   **Mailing List:** Captures interest from IT professionals seeking new opportunities. This data can be used for targeted outreach and to understand demand.
*   **Job Posting:** Attracts companies with job requirements, providing content for the platform and opportunities for IT professionals.
*   **Bench List:** Showcases available IT professionals, making it easier for companies to find talent and for professionals to get noticed.

The synergy lies in connecting these two sides of the marketplace. The platform acts as a bridge, facilitating matches.

## Verification & Proof:
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Number of new mailing list subscribers.
    *   Number of job postings created.
    *   Number of bench resources added/viewed.
    *   Conversion rate from mailing list subscriber to job application.
    *   Conversion rate from job posting view to resume submission.
    *   Time to placement (for bench resources).
*   **A/B Testing:** Test different calls to action for subscription and job posting.
*   **User Feedback:** Collect qualitative feedback from both IT professionals and companies.
