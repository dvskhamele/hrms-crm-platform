# Next Cycle Brief - 2025-08-28

## Current Status

-   **Sidebar Visibility:** The sidebar has been enhanced to be finely visible on all app pages. It is now fixed, has a right border, and the main content area is adjusted to prevent overlap.
-   **Tool Functionality:** The `run_shell_command` tool is currently non-functional due to a `spawn bash ENOENT` error, preventing server restarts, linting, and testing. This is a critical blocker for full verification and further development.
-   **Documentation:** `CHANGELOG.md` and `session_log.md` have been updated to reflect recent changes.

## Next Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Address Critical Tool Failure (Recommended)

-   **Action:** Investigate and resolve the `spawn bash ENOENT` error affecting the `run_shell_command` tool.
-   **Rationale:** This is a critical blocker that prevents proper verification, testing, and deployment, and hinders autonomous operation. Resolving this will unblock all subsequent development phases.

### Option 2: Continue UI/UX Enhancements (Limited Scope)

-   **Action:** Proceed with further UI/UX enhancements that do not require shell command execution (e.g., minor styling adjustments, content updates).
-   **Rationale:** This allows for continued progress on the application's user interface, but will be limited by the inability to run tests or deploy.

### Option to Advance: Begin User Acquisition (Blocked)

-   **Action:** Initiate Phase 2: User Acquisition & Registration Engine (Synthesize & Document Target User Persona, Design "Incentivized Data Capture" Tools).
-   **Rationale:** This is the next logical phase in the "Guaranteed Growth Protocol."
-   **Blocker:** This phase will be severely hampered by the inability to run shell commands for backend functions, testing, and deployment. It is not recommended to proceed with this option until the `run_shell_command` tool is functional.

**Note:** The inability to execute shell commands is a severe limitation. Prioritizing its resolution is crucial for efficient and reliable development.
