# Marketing Plan: Feature-Specific Sub-Tools for Growth

This document outlines proposed marketing sub-tools for each core application feature, designed to drive user acquisition and engagement as per the "Psyche-Architect Protocol" (Phase 3: Growth & Marketing Automation).

## 1. Mailing List Subscription Form
- **Feature Goal:** Capture user emails for communication and lead nurturing.
- **Proposed Sub-Tool: "Content Preview Widget"**
  - **Description:** A small, embeddable widget that displays a snippet of exclusive content (e.g., a few lines of a premium article, a blurred image of a report). To unlock the full content, users are prompted to enter their email address and subscribe to the mailing list.
  - **Marketing Value:** Acts as a lead magnet, demonstrating immediate value and incentivizing email sign-ups by offering a taste of premium content.
  - **Implementation Notes:** Requires a mechanism to serve content snippets and gate full access.

## 2. Job Posting Form
- **Feature Goal:** Attract employers to post job openings.
- **Proposed Sub-Tool: "Job Post Reach Estimator"**
  - **Description:** A simple, interactive calculator where a user inputs basic job details (e.g., industry, role, experience level). The tool then provides an estimated reach (e.g., "Your job post could reach ~5,000 relevant candidates") based on (dummy/placeholder) data.
  - **Marketing Value:** Provides immediate, tangible value to potential job posters by showcasing the platform's potential reach and encouraging them to complete a full job posting.
  - **Implementation Notes:** Requires a simple frontend calculator and a predefined set of estimation rules.

## 3. Bench List Display
- **Feature Goal:** Showcase available talent/resources to potential clients/employers.
- **Proposed Sub-Tool: "Talent Spotlight Widget"**
  - **Description:** An embeddable widget that randomly displays a profile (e.g., name, skill, short bio) from the "Bench List." It includes a clear call to action (e.g., "View More Talent" or "Find Your Next Hire") linking back to the full bench list page.
  - **Marketing Value:** Increases visibility of the talent pool, acts as a passive lead generator, and can be easily shared or embedded on partner sites.
  - **Implementation Notes:** Requires a simple frontend component to fetch and display random profiles, and a mechanism to link back to the main bench list.

## 4. User Authentication (Sign-up/Sign-in)
- **Feature Goal:** Encourage user registration and highlight the benefits of being a registered user.
- **Proposed Sub-Tool: "Personalized Dashboard Preview"**
  - **Description:** A static or interactive demo of the user dashboard. Users can click on various elements (e.g., "My Jobs," "My Applications") to see what a personalized experience would look like, without actually signing up. A prominent call to action to "Sign Up to Unlock Your Dashboard" is present.
  - **Marketing Value:** Addresses user skepticism by visually demonstrating the value of registration, reducing friction by allowing exploration before commitment.
  - **Implementation Notes:** Requires a static HTML/CSS/JS mock-up of the dashboard, potentially with some interactive elements.

**Next Steps:**
I will now select one of these sub-tools to begin implementation, prioritizing based on ease of implementation and potential immediate impact. I propose starting with the **"Job Post Reach Estimator"** as it offers clear, immediate value and can be implemented as a standalone page/component.
