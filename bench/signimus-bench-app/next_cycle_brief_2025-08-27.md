# Next Cycle Brief â€” Psyche-Architect

Date: 2025-08-27

## Last Cycle Summary
- **Sidebar Implementation:** Implemented a persistent sidebar for improved navigation across all pages.
- **Documentation:** Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `session_log.md` to reflect the cycle's progress.

## Key Changes Deployed
- `signimus-bench-app/app/layout.tsx` (Modified)

## Current System Status
- **Dev Server:** Running on `http://localhost:3001`.
- **Navigation:** Enhanced with a new sidebar.

## Next Cycle Priorities
1.  **"Mailing List" Backend (Phase 3.3):**
    *   Implement the backend logic for the "Mailing List" tool. This will involve creating a serverless function to handle the form submission and add new subscribers to the `subscribers` table.
2.  **"Job Posting" Backend (Phase 2.2):**
    *   Implement the backend logic for the "Job Posting" tool. This will involve creating a serverless function to handle the form submission and add new job postings to the `job_postings` table.
3.  **"Bench List" Backend (Phase 2.2):**
    *   Implement the backend logic for the "Bench List" tool. This will involve creating a new Supabase table to store bench resources and a serverless function to fetch the data.

## Unresolved Issues
- The "Mailing List," "Job Posting," and "Bench List" tools currently have no backend logic.

## Approval Gate
- Once the "Mailing List" backend is implemented and functional, proceed with the "Job Posting" backend.
