The command `npx supabase start` consistently fails because port 54321 is allocated by OrbStack, despite attempts to configure a different port in `supabase/config.toml`. The Supabase CLI appears to ignore the `[kong]` port configuration or has a hardcoded dependency on port 54321. Manual intervention required to free port 54321 or configure OrbStack to not use it.",
