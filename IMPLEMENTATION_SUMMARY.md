- **Quick actions**: Daily tasks â†’ Multi-update for all related metrics

#### Candidate Management Automation
- **One-tap screening**: Mark screened â†’ Updates recruiter workload, candidate stage, pipeline %, dashboard metrics
- **Bulk operations**: Process all screening â†’ Updates all candidates and related metrics simultaneously
- **Bench matching**: Drag candidate â†’ Auto-updates bench count, notifies manager, makes candidate available

#### Position Management Automation
- **Status updates**: Close position â†’ Marks filled, notifies recruiters, removes from pipeline, updates metrics
- **Application highlighting**: View applications â†’ Auto-highlights urgent, flags deadlines, suggests next actions

#### Recruiter Management Automation
- **Assignment/reassignment**: Update assignments â†’ Auto-updates candidate stage, workload metrics, dashboard counts
- **Performance badges**: Auto-adjust based on actions (screened, scheduled, placed)
- **Task distribution**: Visual indicators that update in real-time

#### Screening & Scheduling Automation
- **Screen candidate**: Single action â†’ Updates pipeline, recruiter badge, candidate stage, scheduling calendar
- **Schedule interview**: Single action â†’ Updates calendar, notifies recruiter & candidate, updates status, refreshes dashboard
