// This script is responsible for generating a weekly report of all activities.
// For this simulation, it will just log a message to the console.

console.log('AutoReport: Generating weekly report...');

// In a real-world scenario, this script would:
// 1. Read the analytics log file
// 2. Aggregate the data (e.g., number of tool uses, leads captured, etc.)
// 3. Generate an HTML report
// 4. Save the report to the /auto_reports/ directory
