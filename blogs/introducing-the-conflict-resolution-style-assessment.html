        <h1>Introducing the Conflict Resolution Style Assessment</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Conflict Resolution Style Assessment. This tool is designed to help you understand your natural approach to conflict and how you can adapt your style to achieve better outcomes.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Understand Your Conflict Resolution Style?</h2>
        <p>Conflict is a natural part of any workplace. By understanding your own conflict resolution style, as well as the styles of others, you can navigate disagreements more effectively, build stronger relationships, and create a more harmonious and productive work environment.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Conflict Resolution Style Assessment is a short quiz that asks you a series of questions about how you typically respond to conflict. Based on your answers, the tool will identify your dominant conflict resolution style: competing, avoiding, accommodating, compromising, or collaborating.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gain self-awareness about your approach to conflict.</li>
            <li>Learn how to adapt your style to different situations.</li>
            <li>Improve your communication and negotiation skills.</li>
        </ul>
