        <h1>From Chaos to Control: Introducing the Simple Applicant Tracker</h1>
        <p>For a growing startup, hiring is everything. But managing a flood of applications in a spreadsheet or your inbox can quickly become a nightmare. Candidates get lost, feedback gets missed, and a poor experience can tarnish your company's reputation before you even get off the ground. A dedicated Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is the answer, but enterprise-level software is often too complex and expensive for a small team.</p>
        <p>What you need is a simple, visual way to see who is in your pipeline and where they stand. That's why we've built the <a href="/tools/simple-applicant-tracker/" target="_blank">Simple Applicant Tracker</a>. It’s a free, lightweight tool designed to help startups and small businesses manage their hiring process with clarity and ease.</p>

        <div class="tool-link-container">
            <a href="/tools/simple-applicant-tracker/" class="tool-link" target="_blank">Start Tracking Candidates Now</a>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Even Small Teams Need Applicant Tracking</h2>
        <p>You might think an ATS is only for large corporations, but the principles of organized hiring are universal. Here’s why tracking applicants from day one is a smart move:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Never Lose a Good Candidate:</strong> When applications are scattered across emails and folders, it's easy for a promising candidate to slip through the cracks. A central tracker ensures everyone is accounted for.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve Candidate Experience:</strong> A structured process allows you to communicate with candidates in a timely and professional manner, even if it's just to let them know they are no longer being considered.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborate with Your Team:</strong> A tracker provides a single source of truth for your hiring team. Everyone can see the status of each candidate, reducing confusion and duplicate work.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Data-Informed Decisions:</strong> Even simple tracking can reveal bottlenecks in your process. Are candidates getting stuck in the screening phase? Is your interview process too long? A tracker helps you spot these trends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Basic Hiring Pipeline Stages</h2>
        <p>Our tool is built around a standard, proven hiring pipeline. Understanding these stages is the first step to organizing your recruitment efforts.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Applied:</strong> The candidate has submitted their application.</li>
                <li><strong>Screening:</strong> The hiring manager is reviewing the resume and qualifications.</li>
                <li><strong>Interview:</strong> The candidate is actively in the interview process (phone, video, or in-person).</li>
                <li><strong>Offer:</strong> An official job offer has been extended to the candidate.</li>
                <li><strong>Hired:</strong> The candidate has accepted the offer. Congratulations!</li>
                <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> The candidate is no longer being considered for the role.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>How to Use Our Simple Applicant Tracker</h2>
        <p>We designed this tool to be as intuitive as a spreadsheet but with the structure you need to stay organized. (Note: Data is stored in your browser for the current session only).</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Visit the Tool:</strong> Open the <a href="/tools/simple-applicant-tracker/" target="_blank">Simple Applicant Tracker</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Add a Candidate:</strong> Enter the candidate's name and the role they applied for in the form at the top and click "Add Candidate." They will automatically be added to the table with the stage "Applied."</li>
            <li><strong>Update Their Stage:</strong> As the candidate moves through your pipeline, simply use the dropdown menu in the "Stage" column to update their status.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove a Candidate:</strong> If you need to remove a candidate from your list, just click the "Remove" button in their row.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's it! The tool provides a clean, real-time view of your hiring pipeline without the complexity of a full-blown ATS.</p>
