        <h1>Introducing the 30-60-90 Day Plan Generator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new 30-60-90 Day Plan Generator. This tool is designed to help new hires and employees transitioning into new roles create structured, actionable plans for their first three months, ensuring a smooth and successful integration.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is a 30-60-90 Day Plan Essential?</h2>
        <p>The first few months in a new role are critical for success. A 30-60-90 day plan provides a clear roadmap, outlining key objectives, learning goals, and expected contributions for each month. This structured approach helps new employees quickly get up to speed, build confidence, establish credibility, and align their efforts with organizational goals. For managers, it's a valuable tool for guiding, supporting, and evaluating new talent.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The 30-60-90 Day Plan Generator is a simple tool where you input the employee's name, their new role, and their manager's name. The tool then generates a comprehensive plan outline, divided into three distinct phases: Learn & Listen (Days 1-30), Contribute & Collaborate (Days 31-60), and Lead & Optimize (Days 61-90). Each phase includes suggested activities and focus areas, providing a customizable template for a successful transition.</p>
