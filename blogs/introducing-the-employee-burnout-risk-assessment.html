        <h1>Introducing the Employee Burnout Risk Assessment</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Employee Burnout Risk Assessment tool. This tool is designed to help you identify employees who may be at risk of burnout, so you can take proactive steps to support their well-being.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Assess Burnout Risk?</h2>
        <p>Employee burnout can have a significant impact on productivity, morale, and retention. By identifying employees who are at risk of burnout, you can intervene early and provide the support they need to thrive. This can help you create a healthier and more sustainable work environment for everyone.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Employee Burnout Risk Assessment is a short quiz that asks employees a series of questions about their work-related stress and well-being. Based on their answers, the tool calculates a burnout risk score and provides a risk level (low, moderate, or high).</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify employees who may be struggling with burnout.</li>
            <li>Start conversations about mental health and well-being.</li>
            <li>Implement targeted interventions to prevent burnout.</li>
        </ul>
