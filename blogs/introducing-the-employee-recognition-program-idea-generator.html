        <h1>Introducing the Employee Recognition Program Idea Generator</h1>

        <h2>Why is Employee Recognition Important?</h2>
        <p>Employee recognition is a powerful driver of engagement, productivity, and retention. When employees feel valued and appreciated for their contributions, they are more motivated, committed, and satisfied with their work. A well-designed recognition program can significantly boost morale, reinforce positive behaviors, and create a more positive and supportive workplace culture.</p>

Based on your selections, the tool provides a list of tailored ideas for recognition programs, ranging from public shout-outs to professional development opportunities.</p>
