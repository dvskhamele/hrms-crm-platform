        <h2>Why Workplace Safety is Paramount</h2>
        <p>Investing in workplace safety yields significant returns, far beyond mere compliance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protects Employees:</strong> The most important reason is to prevent injuries, illnesses, and fatalities, ensuring your team returns home safely every day.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensures Legal Compliance:</strong> Adherence to regulations set by bodies like OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) in the U.S. is mandatory. Non-compliance can lead to hefty fines and legal action.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduces Costs:</strong> Workplace accidents can result in medical expenses, workers' compensation claims, lost workdays, and increased insurance premiums. Proactive safety saves money.</li>
            <li><strong>Boosts Morale and Productivity:</strong> Employees who feel safe and cared for are more engaged, loyal, and productive. A safe environment reduces stress and anxiety.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhances Reputation:</strong> A company known for its strong safety culture is viewed positively by employees, customers, and the community.</li>
        </ul>
