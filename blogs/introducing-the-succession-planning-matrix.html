        <h1>Introducing the Succession Planning Matrix</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Succession Planning Matrix tool. This tool is designed to help you create a visual representation of your talent pipeline for key roles, ensuring business continuity and future leadership.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Use a Succession Planning Matrix?</h2>
        <p>Succession planning is crucial for long-term organizational health. A succession planning matrix helps you identify critical roles, assess the readiness and potential of internal candidates, and pinpoint any gaps in your talent pipeline. This proactive approach minimizes disruption, fosters employee development, and ensures you have the right people in the right roles when needed.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Succession Planning Matrix tool allows you to input key roles, current incumbents, and assess potential successors based on their readiness and potential (on a scale of 1-5). As you add roles, the tool dynamically builds a table, providing a clear overview of your succession landscape.</p>
