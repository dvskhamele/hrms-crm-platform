        <h1>Introducing the HR Policy Acknowledgment Tracker</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new HR Policy Acknowledgment Tracker. This tool is designed to help HR professionals efficiently track and manage employee acknowledgments of critical HR policies, ensuring compliance and clear communication.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is Tracking Policy Acknowledgment Important?</h2>
        <p>Ensuring employees have read, understood, and acknowledged key HR policies (like the employee handbook, code of conduct, or remote work policy) is crucial for legal compliance, risk mitigation, and fostering a transparent workplace. Proper documentation of these acknowledgments can protect your organization in legal disputes and ensures that all employees are aware of their responsibilities and company expectations.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The HR Policy Acknowledgment Tracker is a simple tool that allows you to record employee names, the specific policy they acknowledged, and the date of acknowledgment. You can easily add new acknowledgments, and the tool will display a list of all recorded entries, providing a clear and organized record of compliance.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain accurate records of employee policy acknowledgments.</li>
            <li>Ensure legal compliance and mitigate potential risks.</li>
