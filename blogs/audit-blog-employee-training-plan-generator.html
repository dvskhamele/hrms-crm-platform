        <p><em>Investing in employee development is key to building a skilled and engaged workforce. To support HR professionals and managers in this endeavor, we are excited to introduce our new Employee Training Plan Generator.

        <h2>The Importance of Structured Training Plans</h2>

        <h2>How to Use the Generator</h2>
        <p>Our Employee Training Plan Generator makes creating comprehensive plans straightforward:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Enter Employee Name and Job Role:</strong> Personalize the plan for the specific employee and their position.</li>
            <li><strong>Define Main Training Goal:</strong> Clearly state the primary objective of the training (e.g., "Master React framework," "Improve leadership skills").</li>
            <li><strong>Add Training Modules/Topics:</strong> List the specific areas of learning or modules the employee will undertake (e.g., "React Basics," "State Management," "API Integration").</li>
            <li><strong>Generate Training Plan:</strong> The tool will produce a basic outline of the training plan, ready for further customization with timelines, resources, and evaluation methods.</li>
        </ol>
