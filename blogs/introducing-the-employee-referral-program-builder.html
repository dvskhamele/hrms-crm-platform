        <h1>Introducing the Employee Referral Program Builder</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Employee Referral Program Builder. This tool is designed to help HR professionals and talent acquisition teams create structured and enticing employee referral programs, leveraging your current workforce to find top talent.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is an Employee Referral Program Essential?</h2>
        <p>Employee referral programs are consistently one of the most effective and cost-efficient ways to hire. Referred candidates often have a higher retention rate, onboard faster, and are a better cultural fit. A well-designed program incentivizes your employees to become active recruiters, tapping into their networks to bring in high-quality candidates who already align with your company values.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Employee Referral Program Builder is a simple tool that allows you to define key aspects of your referral program. You can input the program name, the referral bonus amount, eligibility criteria for referrers and referred candidates, and outline the step-by-step process for submitting and tracking referrals. The tool then generates a clear outline that you can use to launch and communicate your program effectively.</p>
