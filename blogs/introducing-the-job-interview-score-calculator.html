        <h1>Introducing the Job Interview Score Calculator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Job Interview Score Calculator. This tool is designed to help hiring managers and interviewers objectively quantify candidate performance during interviews, leading to more consistent and data-driven hiring decisions.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is an Objective Interview Score Calculator Important?</h2>
        <p>Interviews are a critical stage in the hiring process, but subjective evaluations can lead to unconscious bias and inconsistent assessments. An objective scoring system helps standardize the evaluation process, ensuring all candidates are measured against the same criteria. This leads to fairer comparisons, better documentation, and ultimately, higher quality hires who are a stronger fit for the role and company culture.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Job Interview Score Calculator is a simple tool where interviewers can input scores (on a scale of 1-5) for various predefined criteria such as Technical Skills, Communication Skills, Problem-Solving Skills, and Cultural Fit. The tool then calculates an average score and provides a recommendation (e.g., Strong Hire, Consider for Hire, Do Not Hire), offering a quick and quantifiable summary of the candidate's performance.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Objectively quantify candidate performance during interviews.</li>
            <li>Ensure consistent and fair evaluation across all applicants.</li>
