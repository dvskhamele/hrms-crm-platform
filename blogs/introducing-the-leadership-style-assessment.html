        <h1>Introducing the Leadership Style Assessment</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Leadership Style Assessment tool. This tool is designed to help you understand your natural leadership style and how you can adapt your approach to be a more effective leader.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Understand Your Leadership Style?</h2>
        <p>Effective leadership is crucial for a successful organization. By understanding your own leadership style, you can learn to leverage your strengths and identify areas for development. This can help you to better motivate your team, foster a positive work environment, and achieve your goals.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Leadership Style Assessment is a short quiz that asks you a series of questions about how you typically lead your team. Based on your answers, the tool will identify your dominant leadership style: autocratic, democratic, laissez-faire, or transformational.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gain self-awareness about your leadership style.</li>
            <li>Learn how to adapt your style to different situations.</li>
            <li>Improve your leadership skills and effectiveness.</li>
        </ul>
