        <h1>Introducing the Job Satisfaction Survey</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Job Satisfaction Survey tool. This tool is designed to help you assess the job satisfaction of your employees and identify areas for improvement.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is Job Satisfaction Important?</h2>
        <p>Job satisfaction is a key driver of employee engagement, productivity, and retention. When employees are satisfied with their jobs, they are more likely to be motivated, committed, and productive. A job satisfaction survey can help you identify what is working well and what can be improved.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Job Satisfaction Survey is a short quiz that asks employees a series of questions about their satisfaction with their role, opportunities for growth, relationship with their manager, and the company culture. Based on their answers, the tool calculates a job satisfaction score and provides a satisfaction level (low, moderate, or high).</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gain insights into the job satisfaction of your employees.</li>
            <li>Identify and address factors that may be contributing to low job satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Create a more positive and supportive work environment.</li>
        </ul>
