        <h1>Introducing the Change Management Impact Assessment</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Change Management Impact Assessment tool. This tool is designed to help you assess the potential impact of a change on your organization, so you can plan and manage the change effectively.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Assess the Impact of Change?</h2>
        <p>Change is inevitable, but it doesn't have to be disruptive. By assessing the impact of a change before you implement it, you can identify potential risks and challenges, and develop a plan to mitigate them. This can help you ensure a smooth and successful transition for everyone involved.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Change Management Impact Assessment is a short quiz that asks you a series of questions about the change you are planning. Based on your answers, the tool calculates a change impact score and provides an impact level (low, medium, or high).</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the potential impact of a change on your organization.</li>
            <li>Identify potential risks and challenges.</li>
            <li>Develop a plan to manage the change effectively.</li>
        </ul>
