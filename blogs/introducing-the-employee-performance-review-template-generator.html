        <h2>Why are Structured Performance Reviews Important?</h2>
        <p>Performance reviews are a cornerstone of effective talent management. They provide a formal opportunity to assess employee performance, recognize achievements, identify areas for development, and set future goals. A standardized template ensures consistency, fairness, and compliance across the organization, making the review process more efficient and impactful.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>

The tool then generates a customizable template that includes sections for performance areas (e.g., job knowledge, quality of work, teamwork), strengths, areas for development, future goals, and employee comments. This provides a solid framework for conducting meaningful performance discussions.</p>
