    <h1>Introducing the Behavioral Interview Question Generator: Uncover True Candidate Potential</h1>
    <p>Traditional interview questions often elicit rehearsed answers, making it difficult to truly assess a candidate's real-world skills and behaviors. Behavioral interview questions, however, delve into past experiences to predict future performance.
