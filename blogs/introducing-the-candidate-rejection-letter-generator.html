        <h1>Introducing the Candidate Rejection Letter Generator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Candidate Rejection Letter Generator. This tool is designed to help hiring managers and recruiters craft professional, empathetic, and legally compliant rejection letters for job applicants, maintaining a positive employer brand even when delivering difficult news.</p>
        
        <h2>Why are Thoughtful Rejection Letters Important?</h2>
        <p>Even when a candidate isn't the right fit, a respectful and well-worded rejection letter is crucial for maintaining a positive candidate experience and protecting your employer brand. It shows professionalism, empathy, and can turn a rejected applicant into a future advocate or even a re-applicant for a different role. A good rejection letter can mitigate negative feelings and leave a lasting positive impression.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Candidate Rejection Letter Generator is a simple tool that allows you to input the candidate's name, the job title they applied for, and your company name. You can also optionally include a specific reason for rejection to provide more personalized feedback. The tool then generates a professional and courteous rejection letter template that you can customize and send to candidates.</p>
