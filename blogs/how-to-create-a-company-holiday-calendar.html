        <h1>How to Create a Company Holiday Calendar for Your Business</h1>
        <p>A clear and well-communicated company holiday calendar is essential for employee morale and operational planning. It sets expectations, allows employees to plan their time off, and ensures that business operations run smoothly throughout the year. This guide will walk you through the process.</p>

        <h2>Why You Need a Formal Holiday Calendar</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Everyone in the company knows which days are paid time off.</li>
            <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Helps departments plan for coverage and project timelines around holidays.</li>
            <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Ensures a consistent and fair application of holiday policies for all employees.</li>
            <li><strong>Attraction & Retention:</strong> A generous holiday schedule can be a competitive advantage in the job market.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps to Create Your Company Holiday Calendar</h2>

        <h3>1. Review Federal and State Holidays</h3>
        <p>Start by listing the official public holidays. In the United States, there are 11 federal holidays. Your state or city may have additional official holidays that you should consider including.</p>

        <h3>2. Decide on Your Company's Holiday List</h3>
        <p>While many companies follow the federal holiday schedule, you can customize your list. Some companies offer floating holidays or include the day after Thanksgiving. The key is to be clear and consistent.</p>
        <p>A typical US company holiday calendar might include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New Year's Day</li>
            <li>Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</li>
            <li>Presidents' Day</li>
            <li>Memorial Day</li>
            <li>Juneteenth</li>
            <li>Independence Day</li>
            <li>Labor Day</li>
            <li>Thanksgiving Day</li>
            <li>The day after Thanksgiving</li>
            <li>Christmas Day</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Communicate the Calendar Clearly</h3>
        <p>Once you've finalized the list, publish it where all employees can easily find it, such as in the employee handbook or on the company intranet. Send out a notification at the beginning of the year and reminders before each holiday.</p>
