        <h1>A Guide to UK Statutory Redundancy Pay</h1>
        <p>Redundancy is a difficult process for both employers and employees. Understanding the legal requirements for redundancy pay is crucial for ensuring a fair and compliant process. This guide covers the basics of statutory redundancy pay in the UK (England, Scotland, and Wales).</p>

        <h2>Who is Eligible for Statutory Redundancy Pay?</h2>
        <p>To be eligible for statutory redundancy pay, an individual must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be an employee working under a contract of employment.</li>
            <li>Have at least two years of continuous service with the employer.</li>
            <li>Have been dismissed due to a genuine redundancy situation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How is Statutory Redundancy Pay Calculated?</h2>
        <p>The amount of statutory redundancy pay depends on three factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The employee's age.</li>
            <li>The employee's length of service (capped at 20 years).</li>
            <li>The employee's average weekly pay (capped at a government-set limit, currently Â£700 as of April 2024).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The calculation is based on a multiplier for each full year of service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age 41 and over:</strong> 1.5 weeks' pay for each year of service.</li>
            <li><strong>Age 22 to 40:</strong> 1 week's pay for each year of service.</li>
            <li><strong>Under age 22:</strong> 0.5 week's pay for each year of service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Contractual vs. Statutory Redundancy Pay</h2>
        <p>It's important to note that this guide covers the legal minimum (statutory) redundancy pay. Some employers may offer a more generous contractual redundancy package. Always check the employment contract.</p>
