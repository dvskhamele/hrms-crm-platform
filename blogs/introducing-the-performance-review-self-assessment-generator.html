        <h1>Introducing the Performance Review Self-Assessment Generator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Performance Review Self-Assessment Generator. This tool is designed to help employees reflect on their performance, achievements, and development areas, facilitating more meaningful and productive performance review discussions with their managers.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is Self-Assessment Important in Performance Reviews?</h2>
        <p>Self-assessment is a powerful component of the performance review process. It encourages employees to take ownership of their development, critically evaluate their contributions, and identify their own strengths and areas for growth. This introspection leads to more engaged employees, richer conversations with managers, and a clearer understanding of personal and professional goals. It also helps reduce defensiveness and promotes a collaborative approach to performance improvement.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Performance Review Self-Assessment Generator is a simple tool where you input the employee's name and the review period. The tool then generates a structured self-assessment form with sections for key achievements, strengths, areas for development, future goals, and an overall self-rating. Each section includes prompts to guide thoughtful reflection, providing a comprehensive framework for employees to prepare for their performance review.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourage employees to reflect critically on their performance and contributions.</li>
            <li>Facilitate more productive and collaborative performance review discussions.</li>
