        <h1>Introducing the Job Interview Feedback Form Generator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Job Interview Feedback Form Generator. This tool is designed to help hiring managers and interviewers create structured and comprehensive feedback forms, ensuring consistent, objective, and legally sound candidate evaluations.</p>
        
        <h2>Why are Standardized Interview Feedback Forms Essential?</h2>
        <p>Effective hiring relies on objective and consistent evaluation. Without a structured feedback process, interviews can become subjective, leading to unconscious bias and inconsistent hiring decisions. A standardized feedback form ensures that all candidates are assessed against the same criteria, facilitating fair comparisons, providing clear documentation, and ultimately leading to better hiring outcomes and reduced legal risks.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Job Interview Feedback Form Generator is a simple tool where you input the candidate's name, the job title, the interviewer's name, and key feedback criteria (e.g., Technical Skills, Communication, Cultural Fit). The tool then generates a customizable feedback form template, complete with sections for rating each criterion (1-5), detailed comments, overall impression, and a final recommendation. This structured approach helps interviewers capture thorough and actionable feedback.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create professional and structured interview feedback forms quickly.</li>
            <li>Ensure consistent and objective evaluation of all candidates.</li>
