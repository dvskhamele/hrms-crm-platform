        <h1>Introducing the Employee Offboarding Checklist Generator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Employee Offboarding Checklist Generator. This tool is designed to help you create comprehensive and customized offboarding checklists, ensuring a smooth and compliant departure process for every employee.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is a Structured Offboarding Process Essential?</h2>
        <p>A well-managed offboarding process is just as important as a strong onboarding process. It ensures that all necessary administrative tasks are completed, company assets are recovered, system access is revoked, and valuable feedback is collected through exit interviews. A structured offboarding process protects your company's assets and data, maintains positive relationships with departing employees, and provides insights for continuous improvement.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Employee Offboarding Checklist Generator allows you to input the employee's name and their last day of employment. The tool then generates a tailored checklist covering essential tasks such as conducting exit interviews, collecting company property, revoking system access, finalizing payroll and benefits, and communicating their departure to the team. This ensures a consistent and thorough offboarding process.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>

            <li>Create customized offboarding checklists quickly and efficiently.</li>
