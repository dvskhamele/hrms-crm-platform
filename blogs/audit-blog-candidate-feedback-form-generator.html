        <p><em>Collecting structured and objective feedback after interviews is critical for making sound hiring decisions. To empower recruiters and hiring managers with a streamlined process, we are excited to introduce our new Candidate Feedback Form Generator. This tool helps you create customized forms to ensure consistent and comprehensive candidate evaluations.</em></p>

        <h2>The Challenge of Interview Feedback</h2>
        <p>Without a standardized feedback mechanism, interview notes can be inconsistent, subjective, and difficult to compare across candidates and interviewers. This can lead to biases, missed insights, and ultimately, suboptimal hiring choices. Our generator addresses these challenges by providing a framework for structured feedback.</p>

        <h2>How to Use the Generator</h2>
        <p>Creating a tailored feedback form is simple and quick:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Enter Job Title:</strong> Specify the position for which the feedback is being collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Enter Candidate Name:</strong> Identify the candidate being evaluated.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Evaluation Criteria:</strong> Input the key skills, competencies, or attributes you want interviewers to assess (e.g., Technical Skills, Communication, Problem-Solving, Cultural Fit).</li>
            <li><strong>Generate Form:</strong> The tool will instantly produce a printable feedback form template, complete with your specified criteria, rating scales, and space for detailed comments.</li>
        </ol>

            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensure all interviewers evaluate candidates against the same set of criteria.</li>
            <li><strong>Objectivity:</strong> Reduce bias by focusing feedback on predefined, job-relevant attributes.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Streamline the feedback collection process and make post-interview debriefs more productive.</li>
            <li><strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Facilitate better comparison of candidates and more informed hiring decisions.</li>
