        <h1>Mastering Candidate Communication: Essential Email Templates for Every Stage</h1>
        <p>Effective communication is key to a positive candidate experience. From the moment an application is received to the final offer or rejection, clear, timely, and professional emails can significantly impact your employer brand and attract top talent. This guide provides essential email templates for every stage of the candidate journey.</p>

        <h2>Why Standardized Communication Matters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Maintains a consistent and positive image of your company.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Saves recruiters time by providing ready-to-use templates.</li>
            <li><strong>Candidate Experience:</strong> Keeps candidates informed and engaged, even if they don't get the job.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Ensures consistent messaging and avoids potential legal issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Stages and Email Templates</h2>

        <h3>1. Application Received</h3>
        <p>Acknowledge receipt of the application promptly. This sets a positive tone and manages expectations.</p>
        <p><em>Example:</em> Thank you for your application for the [Job Title] position. We have received your application and our hiring team is currently reviewing it.</p>

        <h3>2. Interview Invitation</h3>
        <p>Provide all necessary details for the interview, including date, time, location (or video link), and who they will be meeting.</p>
        <p><em>Example:</em> We were very impressed with your application and would like to invite you for an interview on [Date] at [Time] at [Location/Link].</p>

        <h3>3. Rejection (Post-Interview)</h3>
        <p>Even if a candidate isn't selected, a respectful and timely rejection email is crucial for maintaining a positive employer brand.</p>
        <p><em>Example:</em> While your background is impressive, we have decided to move forward with other candidates whose qualifications were a closer match for the specific requirements of this role at this time.</p>

        <h3>4. Job Offer</h3>
        <p>Clearly state the offer, including job title, salary, and start date, and express enthusiasm for them joining the team.</p>
        <p><em>Example:</em> We are delighted to offer you the position of [Job Title]! Your starting salary will be [Salary] per annum, with a proposed start date of [Start Date].</p>
