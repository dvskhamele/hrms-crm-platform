        <h2>The Power of 360-Degree Feedback</h2>
        <p>Traditional performance reviews often offer a limited, top-down perspective. 360-degree feedback, also known as multi-rater feedback, provides a more comprehensive view by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Revealing Blind Spots:</strong> Individuals often have different perceptions of their own performance compared to how others perceive them.</li>
            <li><strong>Encouraging Self-Awareness:</strong> Receiving feedback from multiple sources helps individuals understand their impact on others.</li>
            <li><strong>Promoting Development:</strong> Identifies specific areas for growth and provides concrete examples for improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Fostering Open Communication:</strong> Creates a culture where feedback is valued and seen as a tool for growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Supporting Leadership Development:</strong> Particularly effective for leaders who need to understand their influence across various levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our tool helps you harness this power by providing the right questions to ask.</p>
