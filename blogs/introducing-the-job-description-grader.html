        <h1>Introducing the Job Description Grader</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Job Description Grader. This tool is designed to help HR professionals and hiring managers evaluate their job descriptions for clarity, completeness, and effectiveness, ensuring they attract the best talent.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is a High-Quality Job Description Crucial?</h2>
        <p>A well-written job description is your first impression on potential candidates and a critical tool for attracting top talent. It not only outlines the role's responsibilities and requirements but also reflects your company's brand and culture. A clear, comprehensive, and inclusive job description can significantly improve the quality of applicants, reduce time-to-hire, and set accurate expectations for new employees, ultimately leading to better hiring outcomes.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Job Description Grader is a simple tool where you paste the full text of your job description. The tool then analyzes the content based on several criteria, including length, clarity (presence of key sections like responsibilities and qualifications), and inclusive language. It provides a score and actionable feedback, highlighting areas for improvement to make your job descriptions more effective and appealing.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess the quality and effectiveness of your job descriptions.</li>
            <li>Receive instant feedback on areas for improvement.</li>
            <li>Ensure clarity, completeness, and inclusivity in your job postings.</li>
            <li>Attract a wider pool of qualified and diverse candidates.</li>
        </ul>
