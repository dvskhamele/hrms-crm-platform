        <h1>Introducing the Training ROI Calculator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Training ROI Calculator. This tool is designed to help you measure the return on investment for your training programs, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness and impact on your organization.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Calculate Training ROI?</h2>
        <p>Training and development are significant investments for any company. Calculating the Return on Investment (ROI) for your training programs allows you to assess their financial benefits, justify expenditures, and optimize future learning initiatives. It helps demonstrate the tangible value that training brings to employee performance and overall business success.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Training ROI Calculator is a straightforward tool. You input the total costs associated with a training program (e.g., materials, instructor fees, employee time) and the estimated monetary benefits derived from the training (e.g., increased productivity, reduced errors, improved sales). The tool then calculates the percentage return on your training investment.</p>

            <li>Quantify the financial benefits of your training programs.</li>
            <li>Justify training budgets and resource allocation.</li>
