            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-8">Investing in employee development is crucial for fostering a skilled, engaged, and productive workforce. However, to ensure training initiatives are effective, organizations must first accurately identify skill gaps and specific training needs. Gem HRMS introduces its **Employee Training Needs Assessment** &#8212; a free, frontend-only JavaScript tool designed to help HR professionals and managers pinpoint areas for development, enabling targeted training programs that drive individual and organizational growth.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Challenge of Untargeted Training</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">Many organizations offer training programs without a clear understanding of their employees' actual needs. This can lead to wasted resources, low engagement, and minimal impact on performance. Without a systematic approach to assessing training needs, it's difficult to ensure that development initiatives are aligned with strategic business objectives and individual career paths. A targeted approach is essential for maximizing the return on training investments.</p>
