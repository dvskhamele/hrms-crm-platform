    <h1>Introducing the Time Off Request Calculator: Simplify Leave Planning</h1>
    <p>Managing time off requests can be a delicate balance between employee needs and business operations. Employees often wonder how many days they have available, and HR needs to ensure accurate tracking and policy adherence. To simplify this process for everyone, we are excited to launch our new <strong><a href="/tools/time-off-request-calculator/">Time Off Request Calculator</a></strong>!</p>

    <h2>What is the Time Off Request Calculator?</h2>
    <p>This tool helps both employees and HR managers quickly determine available time off. By inputting an employee's accrual rate, current balance, and the number of days requested, the calculator provides an instant projection of their time off balance, along with warnings if the request exceeds available leave.</p>

    <h2>How to Use the Tool</h2>
    <p>Calculating time off is simple:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Enter Accrual Rate:</strong> Input how many days of time off are accrued per month (or other period).</li>
        <li><strong>Enter Current Balance:</strong> Input the employee's current time off balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Enter Requested Days:</strong> Input the number of days the employee wishes to take off.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate New Balance:</strong> Click the "Calculate New Balance" button.</li>
        <li><strong>Review Result:</strong> The tool will display the projected new balance and any relevant messages (e.g., if the request exceeds available leave).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Benefits of Using a Time Off Request Calculator</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity for Employees:</strong> Employees can easily check their available leave before making requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency for HR:</strong> Reduces manual calculations and streamlines the approval process.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevents Over-Requesting:</strong> Employees are immediately aware if their request exceeds their balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Planning:</strong> Facilitates better workforce planning and resource allocation.</li>
    </ul>
