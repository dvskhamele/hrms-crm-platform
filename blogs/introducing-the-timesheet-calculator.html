        <h1>Introducing the Timesheet Calculator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Timesheet Calculator. This tool is designed to help employees and managers accurately calculate work hours, including regular and overtime pay, simplifying payroll processing and ensuring fair compensation.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is an Accurate Timesheet Calculator Essential?</h2>
        <p>Accurate tracking of work hours is fundamental for fair compensation, compliance with labor laws, and effective project management. Manual calculations can be prone to errors, leading to discrepancies, employee dissatisfaction, and potential legal issues. A reliable timesheet calculator streamlines this process, ensuring precision and transparency in payroll.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Timesheet Calculator is a simple tool where you input the start and end times of a shift, the duration of any breaks, the hourly rate, and the overtime multiplier. The tool then automatically calculates the total hours worked, distinguishing between regular and overtime hours, and computes the corresponding pay. It even handles overnight shifts for added convenience.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accurately calculate regular and overtime hours worked.</li>
            <li>Ensure precise payroll processing and fair employee compensation.</li>
