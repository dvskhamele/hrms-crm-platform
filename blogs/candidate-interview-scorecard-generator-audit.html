        <h1>Introducing the Candidate Interview Scorecard Generator</h1>
        <p><em>Posted on: October 23, 2025</em></p>

        <p>In the competitive world of recruitment, making consistent, unbiased, and data-driven hiring decisions is paramount. That's why we're excited to launch our latest free tool: the <strong>Candidate Interview Scorecard Generator</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Why Use an Interview Scorecard?</h2>
        <p>Interview scorecards provide a structured framework for evaluating candidates. By defining key criteria and a consistent scoring system before an interview, you can:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduce Unconscious Bias:</strong> Focus on job-related skills and qualifications rather than gut feelings.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Consistency:</strong> Ensure every candidate is evaluated on the same metrics, making comparisons fair and simple.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance Collaboration:</strong> Give your hiring team a common language and framework for discussing candidates.</li>
                <li><strong>Make Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Justify your hiring choices with concrete data, not just intuition.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>How to Use the Tool</h2>
        <p>Our Candidate Interview Scorecard Generator is designed to be simple and intuitive. Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Enter Basic Information:</strong> Start by adding the Job Title and the Candidate's Name.</li>
            <li><strong>Define Your Criteria:</strong> We've pre-filled a few common criteria to get you started. You can customize these and add as many new criteria as you need. Think about the core competencies for the role, such as "Technical Skills," "Problem-Solving," "Communication," and "Cultural Fit."</li>
            <li><strong>Assign Weights:</strong> Not all criteria are created equal. Assign a weight to each criterion (from 1 to 5) to signify its importance for the role.</li>
            <li><strong>Generate the Scorecard:</strong> With one click, the tool generates a clean, professional scorecard ready for your interview.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Get Your Scorecard</h2>
        <p>After generating the scorecard, you can enter your email to receive a downloadable version. This makes it easy to share with your team and keep on file.</p>
