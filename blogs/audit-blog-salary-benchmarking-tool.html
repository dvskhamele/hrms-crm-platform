                <h2>Introducing the Salary Benchmarking Tool</h2>
                <p>In today's dynamic job market, offering competitive salaries is crucial for attracting and retaining top talent.

                    <li>Ensure internal equity and external competitiveness.</li>
                    <li>Optimize recruitment budgets.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This tool simplifies the process of gaining these critical insights, enabling data-driven compensation strategies.</p>

                <h2>How to Use the Benchmarking Tool</h2>
