        <h1>From Gross to Net: Estimate Your Take-Home Pay with Our New Calculator</h1>
        <p>When you receive a job offer, the salary figure you see is the gross pay. But the amount that actually hits your bank account — your net pay — can be significantly lower. Understanding the difference is key to managing your personal finances. The gap between gross and net is due to taxes and other deductions. But how much should you expect to be taken out?</p>
        <p>To help you get a clearer picture of your real earnings, we're excited to launch the <a href="/tools/gross-to-net-pay-calculator/" target="_blank">Gross-to-Net Pay Calculator</a>. This tool provides a straightforward estimate of your take-home pay after accounting for the most significant deductions: federal income tax and FICA taxes.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Gross Pay vs. Net Pay: What's the Difference?</h2>
        <p>It's simple, but fundamental:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gross Pay:</strong> This is your total earnings before any deductions are taken out. It's the number you see on your employment contract or offer letter.</li>
            <li><strong>Net Pay (Take-Home Pay):</strong> This is the amount of money you actually receive in your paycheck after all deductions have been subtracted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The deductions can be numerous, but they generally fall into a few key categories. Our calculator focuses on the two biggest ones for most people.</p>

        <h2>The Major Deductions: FICA and Federal Income Tax</h2>

        <h3>1. FICA Taxes (Social Security and Medicare)</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>FICA stands for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. It's a U.S. federal payroll tax that funds two major programs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Security:</strong> This provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. For 2023, the employee tax rate is 6.2% on income up to $160,200.</li>
                <li><strong>Medicare:</strong> This funds the hospital insurance program for seniors and people with disabilities. The employee tax rate is 1.45% on all earnings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These taxes are mandatory and are calculated as a flat percentage of your gross income (with a cap for Social Security).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Federal Income Tax</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>This is a progressive tax, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in tax. The U.S. has a system of tax brackets. For 2023, the brackets for a single filer start at 10% for income up to $11,000 and go up to 37% for income over $578,125. Your filing status (like Single or Married Filing Jointly) determines the specific thresholds for these brackets.</p>
