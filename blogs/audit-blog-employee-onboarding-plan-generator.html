        <h2>The Importance of a Strategic Onboarding Plan</h2>
        <p>Effective onboarding goes beyond just paperwork; it's about making new employees feel welcomed, supported, and equipped to succeed. A strategic onboarding plan reduces ramp-up time, increases engagement, and significantly improves retention rates.
