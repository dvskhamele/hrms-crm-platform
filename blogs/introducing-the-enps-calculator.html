        <h1>Introducing the eNPS Calculator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) Calculator. This tool is designed to help you measure employee loyalty and engagement with a simple, yet powerful metric.</p>
        
        <h2>What is eNPS?</h2>
        <p>The Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is a metric used to measure employee loyalty and engagement. It is based on a single question: "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our company as a place to work?" Based on their responses, employees are categorized as promoters (9-10), passives (7-8), or detractors (0-6).</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The eNPS Calculator makes it easy to calculate your eNPS score. Simply enter the number of promoters, passives, and detractors, and the tool will do the rest. The eNPS score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Quickly and easily calculate your eNPS score.</li>
