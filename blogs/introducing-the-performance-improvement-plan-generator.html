        <h1>Introducing the Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Generator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Generator. This tool is designed to help managers create clear and actionable PIPs for employees who need to improve their performance.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Use a Performance Improvement Plan?</h2>
        <p>A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is a structured approach to help employees improve their performance. It provides a clear framework for identifying areas of concern, setting expectations, outlining action steps, and establishing a timeline for improvement. A well-designed PIP can help employees to succeed, while also protecting the company in the event that performance issues persist.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Generator is a simple tool that allows you to generate a PIP by entering the employee's name, the area of concern, the desired outcome, action steps, and a timeline. The tool will then generate a comprehensive PIP that you can use to guide your conversations with employees.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create clear and actionable PIPs quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Provide employees with a roadmap for improvement.</li>
