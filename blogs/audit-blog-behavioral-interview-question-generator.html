        <p><em>To make informed hiring decisions, it's crucial to assess not just what candidates know, but how they apply their knowledge and skills in real-world situations. Our new Behavioral Interview Question Generator is designed to help recruiters and hiring managers craft targeted questions that uncover these critical insights.</em></p>

        <h2>The Power of Behavioral Interviewing</h2>
        <p>Behavioral interviewing is based on the premise that past behavior is the best predictor of future performance. By asking candidates to describe how they handled specific situations, you gain a deeper understanding of their competencies, problem-solving abilities, and cultural fit. However, developing effective behavioral questions can be challenging.</p>

        <h2>How to Use the Generator</h2>
        <p>Our tool simplifies the creation of impactful behavioral interview questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Select a Skill/Competency:</strong> Choose from a list of essential workplace skills such as Communication, Teamwork, Leadership, Problem-Solving, Adaptability, Conflict Resolution, or Time Management.</li>
            <li><strong>Generate Questions:</strong> The tool will instantly provide a set of carefully designed behavioral questions tailored to the selected competency.</li>
        </ol>
