        <h1>Introducing the Job Interview Scorecard Generator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Job Interview Scorecard Generator. This tool is designed to help hiring managers and interviewers create structured and objective scorecards for evaluating job candidates, leading to more consistent and fair hiring decisions.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Use a Job Interview Scorecard?</h2>
        <p>Interview scorecards are essential for reducing bias, ensuring consistency, and making data-driven hiring decisions. They provide a standardized framework for evaluating candidates against predefined criteria, allowing interviewers to focus on relevant skills and experiences. This leads to a more objective assessment, better candidate comparisons, and ultimately, higher quality hires.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Job Interview Scorecard Generator is a simple tool where you input the job title and key interview criteria (e.g., Technical Skills, Communication, Problem-Solving). The tool then generates a customizable scorecard template with these criteria, along with sections for ratings (1-5) and comments. This structured approach helps interviewers capture detailed feedback and make informed recommendations.</p>
