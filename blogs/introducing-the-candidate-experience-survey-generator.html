        <h1>Introducing the Candidate Experience Survey Generator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Candidate Experience Survey Generator. This tool is designed to help you create comprehensive surveys to gather feedback from job applicants, enabling you to optimize your recruitment process and enhance your employer brand.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is Candidate Experience Important?</h2>
        <p>The candidate experience significantly impacts your employer brand, talent attraction, and even your bottom line. A positive experience can turn applicants into brand advocates, while a negative one can deter future talent and damage your reputation. Collecting feedback through surveys allows you to identify pain points, improve your hiring process, and ensure every candidate feels valued.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Candidate Experience Survey Generator is a simple tool that provides a list of questions categorized by different stages of the hiring process: application, interview, and communication. It also includes questions about the overall experience and suggestions for improvement. You can use these questions to build your own customized surveys to gather valuable insights.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generate relevant and insightful questions for candidate experience surveys.</li>
            <li>Identify strengths and weaknesses in your recruitment process.</li>
