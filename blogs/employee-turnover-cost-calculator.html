            <p>Employee turnover is an inevitable part of business, but its true financial impact is often underestimated. Beyond the obvious costs of recruitment, there are significant hidden expenses that can severely affect a company's bottom line. Our new <strong>Employee Turnover Cost Calculator</strong> is a powerful, frontend-only tool designed to help businesses quantify these costs, providing a clear picture of what losing an employee truly entails.</p>

            <h2>The Hidden Costs of Employee Turnover</h2>
            <p>Many organizations only consider the direct costs of hiring a replacement. However, the full cost of turnover includes a wide range of factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recruitment Costs:</strong> Advertising, screening, interviewing, background checks.</li>
                <li><strong>Onboarding & Training:</strong> New hire orientation, training programs, materials, trainer's time.</li>
                <li><strong>Lost Productivity:</strong> Reduced output from the departing employee, vacant position, and ramp-up time for the new hire.</li>
                <li><strong>Management Time:</strong> Time spent by managers on exit interviews, hiring, and training.</li>
                <li><strong>Decreased Morale:</strong> Impact on remaining team members.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Institutional Knowledge:</strong> Valuable experience and expertise walking out the door.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our calculator brings these hidden costs to light, enabling more informed strategic decisions.</p>

            <h2>How Our Tool Quantifies Turnover Costs</h2>
            <p>This intuitive web-based calculator runs entirely in your browser, ensuring privacy and immediate results. By inputting key financial and operational data, businesses can quickly estimate their total turnover cost.</p>
