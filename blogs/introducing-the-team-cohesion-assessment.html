        <h1>Introducing the Team Cohesion Assessment</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Team Cohesion Assessment tool. This tool is designed to help you measure how well your team works together and identify areas for improvement.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is Team Cohesion Important?</h2>
        <p>A cohesive team is a productive team. When team members are able to work together effectively, they are more likely to achieve their goals, innovate, and support each other. A cohesive team is also more resilient in the face of challenges.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Team Cohesion Assessment is a short quiz that asks team members a series of questions about their team's communication, trust, conflict resolution, and commitment. Based on their answers, the tool calculates a team cohesion score and provides a cohesion level (low, moderate, or high).</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gain insights into your team's dynamics.</li>
            <li>Identify areas where your team can improve.</li>
            <li>Take steps to build a stronger, more cohesive team.</li>
        </ul>
