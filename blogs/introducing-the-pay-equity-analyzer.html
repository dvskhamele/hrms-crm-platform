        <h1>Introducing the Pay Equity Analyzer</h1>
        <p>We're excited to announce the launch of our new Pay Equity Analyzer tool. This tool is designed to help HR professionals and business leaders identify and address potential pay gaps within their organizations.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Pay Equity Matters</h2>
        <p>Pay equity is not just a matter of compliance; it's a fundamental aspect of a fair and inclusive workplace. Ensuring that employees are compensated fairly for their work, regardless of gender, race, or other demographic factors, is crucial for attracting and retaining top talent, fostering a positive company culture, and mitigating legal risks.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Pay Equity Analyzer is a simple yet powerful tool. Users can paste their employee data in CSV format, including columns for gender, race, and salary. The tool then calculates the average salary for different demographic groups, providing a clear overview of any potential disparities.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Identify pay gaps across different demographic groups.</li>
            <li>Make data-driven decisions to address pay inequality.</li>
            <li>Promote transparency and trust within your organization.</li>
        </ul>
