        <h1>Introducing the Work-Life Balance Survey</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Work-Life Balance Survey. This tool is designed to help you assess the work-life balance of your employees and identify areas for improvement.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is Work-Life Balance Important?</h2>
        <p>A healthy work-life balance is essential for employee well-being, engagement, and productivity. When employees have a good balance between their work and personal lives, they are less likely to experience burnout and more likely to be motivated and committed to their work.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Work-Life Balance Survey is a short quiz that asks employees a series of questions about their work hours, personal time, and stress levels. Based on their answers, the tool calculates a work-life balance score and provides a balance level (good, fair, or poor).</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gain insights into the work-life balance of your employees.</li>
            <li>Identify and address factors that may be contributing to a poor work-life balance.</li>
            <li>Create a more supportive and flexible work environment.</li>
        </ul>
