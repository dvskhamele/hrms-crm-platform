        <h1>Introducing the Resume Keyword Optimizer</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Resume Keyword Optimizer. This tool is designed to help job seekers tailor their resumes to specific job descriptions, increasing their chances of passing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and landing interviews.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is Resume Keyword Optimization Crucial?</h2>
        <p>In today's digital job market, most companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes before they even reach a human recruiter. These systems scan for keywords and phrases relevant to the job description. If your resume doesn't contain enough of these keywords, it might be rejected automatically, regardless of your qualifications. Optimizing your resume for keywords is essential to get past the ATS and into the hands of hiring managers.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Resume Keyword Optimizer is a simple and effective tool. You paste the job description text and your resume text into the respective fields. The tool then extracts key terms from the job description and compares them against your resume. It highlights keywords you've matched and, more importantly, identifies crucial keywords that are missing from your resume, providing actionable insights for improvement.</p>
