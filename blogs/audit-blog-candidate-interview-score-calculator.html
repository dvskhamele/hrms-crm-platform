        <h1>Audit Blog: Candidate Interview Score Calculator - Objective Hiring Decisions</h1>
        <p><em>Published: October 24, 2025</em></p>

        <p>Hiring the right talent is critical for any organization's success. However, interview processes can often be subjective, leading to inconsistent evaluations and potentially biased hiring decisions. To bring more objectivity, fairness, and structure to candidate assessments, we are excited to introduce our new <strong>Candidate Interview Score Calculator</strong>.</p>

        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Interview+Scoring" alt="Image depicting interview scoring and evaluation">

        <h2>The Challenge of Subjective Interviews</h2>
        <p>Without a standardized scoring system, interviewers may rely on gut feelings or personal biases, which can lead to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inconsistent candidate evaluations across different interviewers.</li>
            <li>Difficulty in comparing candidates objectively.</li>
            <li>Hiring decisions based on subjective impressions rather than job-relevant criteria.</li>
            <li>Legal risks related to discrimination.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our tool addresses these challenges by providing a quantitative framework for evaluating candidates.</p>

        <h2>How Our Tool Works</h2>
        <p>Our Candidate Interview Score Calculator allows hiring teams to define and weight various interview criteria that are most relevant to the job role. You can input:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Criterion:</strong> A specific skill, competency, or attribute being assessed (e.g., 'Technical Skills', 'Problem Solving', 'Communication', 'Cultural Fit').</li>
            <li><strong>Score (1-5):</strong> The rating a candidate receives for that criterion (e.g., 1=Poor, 5=Excellent).</li>
            <li><strong>Weight (%):</strong> The importance of each criterion to the overall role, expressed as a percentage. The sum of all weights should ideally be 100%.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The tool then automatically calculates a weighted average to produce an overall interview score. It also provides a clear recommendation (e.g., 'Highly Recommended', 'Not Recommended') based on the score. All your inputs are saved to local storage for convenience, allowing for easy updates and consistent evaluation practices.</p>

        <h2>Benefits for HR Professionals and Hiring Managers</h2>
        <p>This calculator offers significant advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Objectivity & Fairness:</strong> Standardizes the evaluation process, reducing bias and ensuring all candidates are assessed against the same criteria.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Hiring Decisions:</strong> Leads to more informed and data-driven decisions, increasing the likelihood of hiring the best fit.</li>
            <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Tailor criteria and weights to align with specific job requirements and company values.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Collaboration:</strong> Provides a common framework for interviewers to discuss and compare candidates.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Defensibility:</strong> Creates a documented, objective record of candidate evaluations.</li>
            <li><strong>Time-Saving:</strong> Streamlines the scoring process, allowing managers to focus more on candidate interaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Beyond the Score: Holistic Candidate Assessment</h2>
        <p>While the score provides a quantitative measure, it should be used as part of a holistic assessment. The tool helps structure the evaluation, but qualitative observations, cultural fit, and overall potential remain important. The score serves as a strong foundation for discussion and decision-making among the hiring panel.</p>
