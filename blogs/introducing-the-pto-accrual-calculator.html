        <h1>Introducing the PTO Accrual Calculator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new PTO Accrual Calculator. This tool is designed to help employees and HR professionals accurately calculate Paid Time Off (PTO) accrual, ensuring transparency and proper management of employee leave balances.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is an Accurate PTO Accrual Calculator Important?</h2>
        <p>Accurate PTO accrual is vital for employee satisfaction and HR compliance. Miscalculations can lead to confusion, disputes, and administrative burdens. A reliable calculator ensures that employees understand how much time off they have earned, and helps HR manage leave liabilities effectively, promoting trust and fairness within the organization.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The PTO Accrual Calculator is a simple tool where you input the hours an employee works per pay period, the company's accrual rate (hours earned per hour worked), and an optional maximum accrual limit. The tool then calculates the amount of PTO accrued per pay period, providing a clear and immediate result. This helps both employees and HR keep track of leave balances.</p>
