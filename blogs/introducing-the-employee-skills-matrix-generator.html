        <h1>Introducing the Employee Skills Matrix Generator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Employee Skills Matrix Generator. This tool is designed to help HR professionals and managers visualize and track the skills and competencies within their teams and organization, facilitating better talent management and development.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is an Employee Skills Matrix Essential?</h2>
        <p>An employee skills matrix provides a clear overview of the capabilities present within your workforce. It helps identify strengths, pinpoint skill gaps, and inform strategic decisions regarding training, recruitment, and project assignments. By understanding who has what skills and at what level, you can optimize team composition, foster internal mobility, and ensure your organization is equipped to meet its strategic objectives.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Employee Skills Matrix Generator is an interactive tool that allows you to input employee names, their relevant skills (comma-separated), and assign a skill level (1-5). As you add this data, the tool dynamically builds a comprehensive skills matrix table. This matrix provides a visual representation of your team's collective capabilities, making it easy to spot areas of expertise and areas needing development.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
