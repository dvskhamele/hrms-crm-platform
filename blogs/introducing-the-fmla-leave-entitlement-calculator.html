        <h1>Introducing the FMLA Leave Entitlement Calculator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new FMLA Leave Entitlement Calculator. This tool is designed to help HR professionals and employees quickly assess eligibility for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), ensuring compliance and clarity.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is Understanding FMLA Entitlement Crucial?</h2>
        <p>The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for specific family and medical reasons. Navigating FMLA regulations can be complex, and accurately determining employee eligibility is vital for compliance, avoiding legal issues, and supporting employee well-being during critical life events. This calculator simplifies a key aspect of FMLA administration.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The FMLA Leave Entitlement Calculator is a simple tool where you input an employee's hours worked and weeks worked within the last 12 months. Based on these two primary criteria (12 months of employment and 1,250 hours worked), the tool provides an indication of whether the employee is likely eligible for FMLA leave. It also includes a disclaimer that this is a simplified calculation and not a substitute for professional HR or legal advice.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quickly assess an employee's FMLA eligibility based on key criteria.</li>
