                <h2>Introducing the Time to Hire Calculator</h2>
                <p>The speed and efficiency of your recruitment process significantly impact an organization's ability to attract top talent and maintain productivity. Our new <strong>Time to Hire Calculator</strong> is designed to help HR professionals and talent acquisition specialists accurately measure one of the most critical recruitment metrics: the time it takes to fill a position. This tool provides a clear indicator of recruitment efficiency, from the moment a job is opened to when an offer is accepted.</p>

                <h2>Why Tracking Time to Hire is Essential</h2>
                <p>A lengthy hiring process can lead to several negative outcomes, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loss of top candidates to competitors.</li>
                    <li>Increased recruitment costs.</li>
                    <li>Reduced team productivity due to open roles.</li>
                    <li>Negative candidate experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By understanding and optimizing your time to hire, organizations can enhance their competitive edge, improve candidate experience, and ensure business continuity. This calculator simplifies the process of tracking this key metric, enabling data-driven process improvements.</p>

                <h2>How to Use the Time to Hire Calculator</h2>
