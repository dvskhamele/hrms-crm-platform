        <h2>The Challenge of Crafting Review Comments</h2>
        <p>Writing performance review comments that are both accurate and motivating requires careful thought and precise language. Managers often struggle with finding the right words, leading to generic feedback or comments that don't fully capture an employee's performance. Our generator aims to alleviate this challenge.</p>

        <h2>How to Use the Generator</h2>
        <p>The Performance Review Comment Generator is straightforward:</p>
        <ol>

            <li><strong>Specify Performance Area:</strong> Choose or type the area of performance you are reviewing (e.g., Communication, Teamwork, Problem Solving).</li>
            <li><strong>Select Performance Level:</strong> Indicate whether the employee Exceeds, Meets, or Needs Improvement in that area.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Specific Examples (Optional):</strong> Provide concrete examples to support your assessment, making the feedback more impactful.</li>
            <li><strong>Generate Comment:</strong> The tool will instantly produce a well-phrased comment that you can use or adapt.</li>
