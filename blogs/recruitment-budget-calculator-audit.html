        <h1>New Tool: The Recruitment Budget Calculator</h1>
        <p><em>Posted on: October 23, 2025</em></p>

        <p>Effective recruitment requires not only a strong strategy but also a well-managed budget. To help HR and talent acquisition teams plan and control their spending, we're excited to launch our new <strong>Recruitment Budget Calculator</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Why a Dedicated Recruitment Budget Calculator?</h2>
        <p>Recruitment costs can quickly add up, from job postings and agency fees to assessment tools and onboarding. A specialized calculator helps you to:
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Optimize Spending:</strong> Identify areas where you can allocate resources more efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Justify Investments:</strong> Present clear financial projections to stakeholders.</li>
                <li><strong>Track Performance:</strong> Compare planned vs. actual spending to refine future budgets.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>How the Recruitment Budget Calculator Works</h2>
