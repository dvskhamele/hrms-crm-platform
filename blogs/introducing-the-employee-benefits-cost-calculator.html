        <h1>Introducing the Employee Benefits Cost Calculator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Employee Benefits Cost Calculator. This tool is designed to help you understand and calculate the total cost of providing employee benefits, a significant component of your overall compensation strategy.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Calculate Employee Benefits Costs?</h2>
        <p>Employee benefits are a crucial part of attracting and retaining talent, but they also represent a substantial expense for businesses. Accurately calculating these costs allows you to manage your budget effectively, evaluate the ROI of your benefits package, and communicate the true value of compensation to your employees. This transparency can enhance employee satisfaction and aid in strategic financial planning.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Employee Benefits Cost Calculator is a simple tool where you input monthly costs for various benefits per employee (e.g., health insurance, dental & vision, retirement contributions, paid time off, and other benefits) and the total number of employees. The tool then calculates the total benefits cost per employee per month, total per month, and total per year.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gain a clear understanding of your total employee benefits expenditure.</li>
