        <h1>Introducing the Employee Feedback Analyzer</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Employee Feedback Analyzer. This tool is designed to help HR professionals and managers quickly process and understand employee feedback, identifying common themes and sentiment to drive actionable insights and improvements.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is Analyzing Employee Feedback Crucial?</h2>
        <p>Employee feedback is a goldmine of information that can significantly impact organizational health, productivity, and retention. However, manually sifting through large volumes of comments can be time-consuming and challenging. An effective feedback analyzer helps you to quickly identify patterns, understand employee sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and pinpoint key areas of concern or success, enabling data-driven decisions to improve the workplace.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Employee Feedback Analyzer is a simple tool where you paste employee feedback entries, with each entry on a new line. The tool then performs a basic sentiment analysis (categorizing feedback as positive, negative, or neutral based on keywords) and identifies common themes (e.g., teamwork, growth, management, workload). This provides a quick, high-level overview of the feedback, helping you to prioritize areas for action.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quickly analyze large volumes of employee feedback.</li>
            <li>Identify overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) within the feedback.</li>
            <li>Pinpoint common themes and recurring issues or successes.</li>
            <li>Drive data-driven decisions to improve employee experience and engagement.</li>
        </ul>
