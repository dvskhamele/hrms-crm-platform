        <h1>Introducing the cNPS Calculator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Candidate Net Promoter Score (cNPS) Calculator. This tool is designed to help you measure the candidate experience and identify areas for improvement.</p>
        
        <h2>What is cNPS?</h2>
        <p>The Candidate Net Promoter Score (cNPS) is a metric used to measure the candidate experience. It is based on a single question: "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?" Based on their responses, candidates are categorized as promoters (9-10), passives (7-8), or detractors (0-6).</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The cNPS Calculator makes it easy to calculate your cNPS score. Simply enter the number of promoters, passives, and detractors, and the tool will do the rest. The cNPS score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Quickly and easily calculate your cNPS score.</li>
