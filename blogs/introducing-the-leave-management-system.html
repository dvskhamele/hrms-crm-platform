        <h1>Introducing the Leave Management System</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Leave Management System. This tool is designed to help HR professionals and employees efficiently manage and track leave requests, ensuring transparency and compliance with company policies.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is an Efficient Leave Management System Essential?</h2>
        <p>Managing employee leave can be a complex and time-consuming task. An efficient system streamlines the process of requesting, approving, and tracking various types of leave (sick, vacation, personal). This reduces administrative burden, minimizes errors, ensures fair application of policies, and provides clear visibility into employee availability, which is crucial for workforce planning and productivity.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Leave Management System is a simple tool that allows employees to submit leave requests by entering their name, leave type, and desired start and end dates. The tool then displays a list of submitted requests, providing a basic overview of pending leaves. While this is a simplified version, it demonstrates the core functionality of a system designed to bring order and clarity to leave management.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Streamline the process of submitting and tracking employee leave requests.</li>
            <li>Ensure fair and consistent application of leave policies.</li>
            <li>Improve transparency regarding employee availability.</li>

        </ul>
