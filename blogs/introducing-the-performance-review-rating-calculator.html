        <h1>Introducing the Performance Review Rating Calculator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Performance Review Rating Calculator. This tool is designed to help managers objectively calculate an employee's overall performance rating based on key criteria, ensuring fairness and consistency in evaluations.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is an Objective Performance Rating System Important?</h2>
        <p>Performance reviews are crucial for employee development and organizational success, but subjective ratings can lead to bias and inconsistency. An objective rating calculator provides a standardized method for evaluating performance against predefined criteria, such as goal achievement, competencies, and overall contribution. This approach enhances fairness, transparency, and the credibility of the review process, leading to more meaningful feedback and better development outcomes.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Performance Review Rating Calculator is a simple tool where managers can input scores (on a scale of 1-5) for various performance criteria. These criteria typically include Goal Achievement, Competency Score, and Overall Contribution. The tool then calculates an average score and translates it into an overall performance rating (e.g., Outstanding, Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, Needs Improvement, Unsatisfactory), providing a clear and quantifiable summary of the employee's performance.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Objectively calculate overall performance ratings for employees.</li>
            <li>Ensure consistency and fairness in performance evaluations.</li>
