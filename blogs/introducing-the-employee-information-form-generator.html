        <h1>Introducing the Employee Information Form Generator</h1>
        <p>We're excited to launch our new Employee Information Form Generator. This tool is designed to help HR departments and new hires quickly generate a standardized form for collecting essential employee data, streamlining the onboarding process.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is a Standardized Employee Information Form Important?</h2>
        <p>Collecting accurate and complete employee information is a foundational HR task. A standardized form ensures that all necessary data—from personal details and contact information to emergency contacts and payroll details—is gathered consistently. This streamlines the onboarding process, reduces administrative errors, ensures compliance with record-keeping regulations, and provides a reliable database for all HR-related functions.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Employee Information Form Generator is a simple tool where you input key employee details such as full name, employee ID, position, department, start date, contact number, and email address. The tool then generates a basic, printable form that includes these details along with blank sections for emergency contacts, bank details for payroll, and employee/manager signatures. This provides a ready-to-use template for your HR needs.</p>
        
        <p>This tool will help you:</p>
