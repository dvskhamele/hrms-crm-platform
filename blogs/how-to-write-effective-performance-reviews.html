        <h1>A Manager's Guide to Writing Effective Performance Reviews</h1>
        <p>Performance reviews are a cornerstone of employee development and performance management. When done well, they can motivate employees, clarify expectations, and provide a clear path for growth. When done poorly, they can demotivate and disengage. This guide provides tips for writing reviews that are both effective and constructive.</p>

        <h2>Be Specific and Provide Examples</h2>
        <p>Vague feedback is not actionable. Instead of saying "Good work," say "Your work on the Q3 report was exceptional because you included detailed data visualizations that made the information easy to understand." Use specific, observable examples to illustrate your points.</p>

        <h2>Balance Strengths and Areas for Improvement</h2>
        <p>A good review should be balanced. Acknowledge the employee's accomplishments and strengths, but also provide constructive feedback on areas where they can grow. Frame areas for improvement in a forward-looking way, focusing on development rather than criticism.</p>

        <h2>Align with Goals</h2>
        <p>Tie your feedback to the employee's goals and the company's objectives. This helps the employee understand how their work contributes to the bigger picture and makes the feedback more relevant and impactful.</p>

        <h2>Make it a Two-Way Conversation</h2>
        <p>The written review is just one part of the process. The review meeting should be a dialogue. Ask the employee for their perspective, listen to their feedback, and work together to set goals for the next review period.</p>
