    <h1>Introducing the Candidate Feedback Form Generator: Streamline Interview Evaluations</h1>
    <p>Collecting structured and consistent feedback from interviewers is crucial for making informed hiring decisions and ensuring a fair evaluation process. Without a standardized approach, feedback can be subjective, incomplete, or difficult to compare. To help HR managers and recruiters streamline their interview evaluation process, we are excited to launch our new <strong><a href="/tools/candidate-feedback-form-generator/">Candidate Feedback Form Generator</a></strong>!</p>

    <h2>What is the Candidate Feedback Form Generator?</h2>
    <p>This tool allows you to quickly generate structured feedback forms tailored to specific job roles. By inputting the job title and interviewer's name, you can create a comprehensive form that guides interviewers through key competencies, overall impressions, strengths, and areas for development, ensuring all critical aspects of a candidate's performance are captured.</p>

    <h2>How to Use the Tool</h2>
    <p>Generating a candidate feedback form is simple:</p>
