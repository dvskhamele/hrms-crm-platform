## Staff Tracking Mechanisms

### Time & Attendance Tracking
```javascript
// Sample attendance tracking logic
class AttendanceTracker {
  constructor() {
    this.attendanceRecords = new Map();
    this.shiftSchedules = new Map();
  }

  recordClockIn(staffId, timestamp, location) {
    const record = {
      staffId,
      clockIn: timestamp,
      location,
      status: 'present'
    };
    
    this.attendanceRecords.set(staffId, record);
    this.sendNotification(staffId, 'clock_in');
  }

  recordClockOut(staffId, timestamp) {
    const record = this.attendanceRecords.get(staffId);
    if (record) {
      record.clockOut = timestamp;
      record.hoursWorked = this.calculateHours(record.clockIn, timestamp);
      this.processPayrollData(record);
    }
  }

  calculateHours(clockIn, clockOut) {
    // Implementation for calculating worked hours
    return (clockOut - clockIn) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  }
}
```

### Performance Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
// Sample performance scoring system
class PerformanceScorer {
  constructor() {
    this.metricsWeights = {
      taskCompletion: 0.3,
      qualityScore: 0.25,
      punctuality: 0.2,
      teamwork: 0.15,
      innovation: 0.1
    };
  }

  calculatePerformanceScore(staffId, period) {
    const metrics = this.collectMetrics(staffId, period);
    
    return Object.keys(this.metricsWeights).reduce((score, metric) => {
      return score + (metrics[metric] * this.metricsWeights[metric]);
    }, 0);
  }

  collectMetrics(staffId, period) {
    // Collect various performance metrics
    return {
      taskCompletion: this.getTaskCompletionRate(staffId, period),
      qualityScore: this.getQualityAssessment(staffId, period),
      punctuality: this.getPunctualityScore(staffId, period),
      teamwork: this.getTeamworkRating(staffId, period),
      innovation: this.getInnovationPoints(staffId, period)
    };
  }
}
```

### Automated Task Assignment
```javascript
// Sample task assignment logic
class TaskAssigner {
  constructor() {
    this.staffSkills = new Map();
    this.currentWorkloads = new Map();
  }

  assignTask(task) {
    const eligibleStaff = this.findEligibleStaff(task.requiredSkills);
    const optimalStaff = this.selectOptimalStaff(eligibleStaff, task.priority);
    
    if (optimalStaff) {
      this.dispatchTask(optimalStaff.id, task);
      this.updateWorkload(optimalStaff.id, task.estimatedDuration);
      return optimalStaff.id;
    }
    
    return null;
  }

  findEligibleStaff(requiredSkills) {
    return Array.from(this.staffSkills.entries())
      .filter(([staffId, skills]) => 
        requiredSkills.every(skill => skills.has(skill))
      );
  }

  selectOptimalStaff(eligibleStaff, priority) {
    // Sort by workload (ascending) and skills match (descending)
    return eligibleStaff
      .sort((a, b) => {
        // Lower workload first
        const workloadDiff = this.currentWorkloads.get(a[0]) - this.currentWorkloads.get(b[0]);
        if (workloadDiff !== 0) return workloadDiff;
        
        // Higher skill match count second
        return b[1].size - a[1].size;
      })
      .shift();
  }
}
```
