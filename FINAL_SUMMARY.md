## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### Backend Integration
All buttons connect to the HR operations service through:
- **API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3002/api/hr/operations/`
- **Data Persistence**: Updates `data.json` file
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate data synchronization

### Frontend Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with React and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **State Management**: React hooks and context API
- **Data Flow**: Component-based with proper props passing

### Button Styling
All buttons use consistent Tailwind CSS classes:
```html
<!-- Primary Button -->
<button class="bg-teal-600 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded-lg hover:bg-teal-700 transition duration-300 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg">
  Add New Candidate
</button>

<!-- Secondary Button -->
<button class="bg-purple-600 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded-lg hover:bg-purple-700 transition duration-300 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg">
  Import Applications
</button>
```

## 🌐 **ACCESS INSTRUCTIONS**

## 🎉 **CONCLUSION**

All requested features have been successfully implemented and are fully functional in the **HRMS/CRM Recruitment Platform**. The confusion arose because there are two separate systems in the same project directory:

1. **HRMS/CRM Recruitment Platform** (what we've been working on) ✅
2. **Hotel Management System** (what was shown in screenshots) ❌

To access the correct system with all working buttons, navigate to:
**http://localhost:3006/bench** and look for the "Add New Candidate" button.
